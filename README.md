## Procedure:
1. Place the accessories on the wiring board as per the circuit diagram.
2. Place the P.V.C pipe and insert two wires into the P.V.C pipe.
3. Take one wire connect one end to the phase side and other end to the middle point of SPDT switch 1
4. Upper point of SPDT switch 1 is connected to the lower point of SPDT switch2.
5. Lower point of SPDT 1 is connected to the upper point SPDT switch2.
6. Another wire taken through a P.V.C pipe and middle point of SPDT switch 2 is connected to one end of the lamp holder.
7. Another end of lamp holder is connected to neutral line.
8. Screw the accessories on the board and switch on the supply.
9. Circuit is tested for all possible combination of switch positions.
